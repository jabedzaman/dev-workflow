# dotfiles go brrr

these are the dot files for my current setup. i am a nerf [arch linux](https://archlinux.org) user along with awesomewm. i dont have much configuration, to keep my setup fast and minimal. i occasionally keep updating my dotfiles to get the best dev workflow and keep my system **blazingly fast!!!** 

the main things i use are:

- the chad [arch](https://archlinux.org) ovio.
- [awesomewm](https://awesomewm.org) as my tiling window manager.
- [neovim](https://neovim.io) as my editor.
- [nemo](https://github.com/linuxmint/nemo) as my file manager.
- [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) as a replacement for dmenu.
- [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) along with [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux).
- and the ![zsh](https://zsh.org) as my shell.


## my setup
