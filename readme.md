# Dotfiles go brrr

These are the dot files for my current setup. I am a nerf ![arch linux](https://archlinux.org) user along with awesomewm. I dont have much configuration, to keep my setup fast and minimal. I occasionally keep updating my dotfiles to get the best dev workflow and keep my system **blazingly fast!!!** 

The main things I use are:

- the chad ![Arch](https://archlinux.org) ovio. 
- ![awesomewm](https://awesomewm.org) as my tiling window manager.
- ![Neovim](https://neovim.io) as my editor.
- ![Nemo](https://github.com/linuxmint/nemo) as my file manager.
- ![Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) as a replacement for dmenu
- ![alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) along with ![tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
- And the ![zsh](https://zsh.org) as my shell

## My setup

Currently, I use a Dell Inspiron with intel i51135G7(4-core)CPU with 16GiB of RAM.
